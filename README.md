# Satellite_detection_models

Scripts to convert ROO (Robotic Optical Observatory) telescope images and train a YOLOv11n model to detect sidereal satellite track-lets

Image conversion script is a modified script generated by ChatGPT 5 and takes FIT image files and converts them to PNG.

The image labelling process is not included in this script; this needs to happen so the images can be used to train the YOLOv11 models. 

Traning_Script.py should be used to debug before training.

Google_Colab_Script.ipynb should be copied into Google Colab and used to train models. 

Assessment of model effectiveness can be tested using generalisation_test.py.

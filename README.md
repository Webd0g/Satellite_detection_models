Scripts to convert ROO (Robotic Optical Observatory) telescope images and train a YOLOv11n model to detect sidereal satellite track-lets
Image conversion script is a modified script generated by ChatGPT 5 and takes FIT image files and converts them to PNG. 
The image labelling process is not included in this script, this needs to happen so the images can be used to train the YOLOv11 models.
